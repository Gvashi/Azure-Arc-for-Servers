## Azure Arc: Hands-on Lab

Lab time: 2 Hours

For customers who want to simplify complex and distributed environments across on-premises, edge and multi-cloud, Azure Arc enables deployment of Azure services anywhere and extends Azure management to any infrastructure.

This hands-on lab introduces readers to Azure Arc and includes walkthrough of setup and management of connected scenarios through Azure Arc.


# Exercise 1: Getting started with Azure Governance 

In this exercise, you will walk through some of the Azure Governance capabilities including Azure Activity Logs, Resource tags and policies. In the first exercise we’ll be trying out these capabilities with Azure resources and then extend to Azure Arc later during the lab.  
 
# Exercise 2: Getting started with Azure Arc
In the provided lab environment, you would already have one Windows Server running on-prem in a **Hyper-V** machine connected through Arc. In this exercise, we’ll explore this **pre-connected** Azure Arc resources.

# Exercise 3: Connect On-Prem Servers to Azure with Arc
Azure Arc extends Azure Resource Manager capabilities to Linux and Windows servers, as well as Kubernetes clusters on any infrastructure across on-premises, multi-cloud, and edge. With Azure Arc, customers can also run Azure data services anywhere, realizing the benefits of cloud innovation, including always up-to-date data capabilities, deployment in seconds (rather than hours), and dynamic scalability on any infrastructure. Azure Arc for servers is currently in public preview.

# Exercise 4: Azure Governance for Arc Connected Machine
